# Learning python through projects
 A repository of small python projects to learn python.
 
 If you see any changes you would like to make start up a pull request. I will be very active.
 
 If you would like to add any small beginner friendly projects to the repository you are free to do so.

Feel free to drop by my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLVPUv-EioOHl3HHEUdAFEg) and check out my [python play-list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovMQ28RlfHE&list=PLUnSepD40W-n1yFwzIC6Ma0e5GhPLDJ0S)
